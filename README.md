took me much too long

Our game is a rogue-like card game, like many others. The game name is "Generic Card Game". In the game, you fight your enemies in rounds, and every round, your enemy gets stronger. But, you too get stronger, as you get to go to the shop with the coins you have after every round.

AI Tools: ChatGPT. That's all. Unfortunately.

Iremide: Brains of the project, created card ideas, some ideas for the gameplay, created the presentation, etc.
Nick: Brawns of the project, spent much too long trying to code the game in GoDot, made the executive decision to switch to Python, and didn't sleep an entire night solely to get it barely functional

Total time spent making game: 20ish.
Satisfaction with game: 5/10, I wish I could've added some of the features I was thinking of, but I guess it would take too long, maybe I'll rework this project in the future and publish it. However, I am glad to get the chance to make an actual game sort of.
